Object-oriented programming is a type programming paradigm that revolves around objects. The user
places data into classes, and the class serves as the general framework for the objects come from it.
For instance, a class could be a 'person', and an instance of a person could be a specific person, like me.
OOP also has a bunch of other features like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to help you more
easily work with the data you have.

Procedural programming doesn't really have this idea of hierarchy built into it. It is the 'vanilla' of
coding paradigms, or something like a base or starter type. Procedural programming just focuses on executing
commands in a certain order. It lacks the structure that OOP inherently has.

GUI stands for graphical user interface and it's what usually comes to mind when you say 'app' or 'website'.
It's the part of the program that the user sees and interacts with. It involves things like buttons
and textboxes. It is actually one of the most important parts of any application, but moreso for
geomatics applications. Since geomatics involves the analysis of the earth, it's essential that users
are able to visualize and interact with geodata to make it easier to understand. If we were limited to
typing in a computer terminal, it would be really tricky to make things like CAD. Imagine if you had to
manually set the length and angle of a line, when it's much more intuitive to click and drag. In short,
GUIs make working with geodata easier by allowing the users to approach it in a visual and more
intuitive way.

Operation overloading is when you override the function an operator currently has. For example, the
operator (*) is used to multiply values. But, when you overload the operation, you can change what the
(*) symbol does. It's very useful for when you need to write lots of code or use a specific function
many times. But overloading too many times might lead to confusion, so it's best not to overdo it.

Inheritance is a key feature in OOP. It's not much different from how we understand inheritance in
layman's terms. For example, you have a parent class called Clothing. The parent class could have attributes
like type of fabric, price, color, and size. Then you have a child class under Clothing called Shirt. Shirt
inherits clothing's attributes, but has a few features that sets it apart. To be specific, its special
attribute could be that you wear it on the top half of your body. 

Much like how we inherit our family's last name but have a unique first name of our own, inheritance
works by passing down the parent attribute but modifying some others.

Front-end is the part of the program that the user is able to access and interact with. Likening
full stack development to a human, the front end is our skin, hair, nails, or our outward appearance
in general. We take care of it so it looks neat and presentable because that's what the people around
us first see when they interact with us.

Back-end is where the 'work' actually gets done. In my human analogy, the back-end is our organs, 
cells, and tissues. They are hidden, working behind the scenes to keep us healthy and alive. 
Also, just as the front-end is nothing without the back-end, our appearance is all for nothing
if our hearts stop beating or if the inner working of our bodies fail.

The database is where data is stored and retrieved. In humans, it would be like the nucleus of a cell,
containing the DNA that the cells use as instruction to do things. It could also be like the brain,
where we store memories and other unconscious information (like how to breathe) to be used by the 
worker cells and organs.
